<h2>
    INTRODUCTION
</h2>
<p>
    As our blessed Lord has required us to pray
    that his kingdom may come, and his will be
    done on earth as it is in heaven, it becomes us
    not only to express our desires of that event by
    words, but to use every lawful method to spread
    the knowledge of his name. In order to this, it
    is necessary that we should become, in some measure
    acquainted with the religious state of the
    world; and as this is an object we should be
    prompted to pursue, not only by the gospel of
    our Redeemer, but even by the feelings of humanity,
    so an inclination to conscientious activity
    therein would form one of the strongest proofs
    that we are the subjects of grace, and partakers of
    that spirit of universal benevolence and genuine
    philanthropy, which appear so eminent in the
    character of God himself.
</p>
<p>
    Sin was introduced amongst the children of
    men by the fall of Adam, and has ever since been
    spreading its baneful influence. By changing its
    appearances to suit the circumstances of the times,
    it has grown up in ten thousand forms, and constantly
    counteracted the will and designs of God.
    One would have supposed that the remembrance
    of the deluge would have been transmitted from
    father to son, and have perpetually deterred
    mankind from transgressing the will of their
    Maker; but so blinded were they, that in the
    time of Abraham, gross wickedness prevailed
    wherever colonies were planted, and the iniquity
    of the Amorites was great, though not yet full.
    After this, idolatry spread more and more, till
    the seven devoted nations were cut off with the
    most signal marks of divine displeasure. Still,
    however, the progress of evil was not stopped,
    but the Israelites themselves too often joined with
    the rest of mankind against the God of Israel. In
    one period the grossest ignorance and barbarism
    prevailed in the world; and afterwards, in a more
    enlightened age, the most daring infidelity, and
    contempt of God; so that the world which was
    once over-run with ignorance, now <i>by wisdom
    knew not God, but changed the glory of the incorruptible God</i>
    as much as in the most barbarous ages,
    <i>into an image made like to corruptible man, and to
    birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things</i>.
    Nay, as they increased in science and politeness,
    they ran into more abundant and extravagant
    idolatries.
</p>
<p>
    Yet God repeatedly made known his intention
    to prevail finally over all the power of the Devil,
    and to destroy all his works, and set up his own
    kingdom and interest among men, and extend it
    as universally as Satan had extended his. It was
    for this purpose that the Messiah came and died,
    that God might be just, and the justifier of all
    that should believe in him. When he had laid
    down his life, and taken it up again, he sent
    forth his disciples to preach the good tidings to
    every creature, and to endeavour by all possible
    methods to bring over a lost world to God.
    They went forth according to their divine commission,
    and wonderful success attended their
    labours; the civilized greeks, and uncivilized barbarians,
    each yielded to the cross of Christ, and
    embraced it as the only way of salvation. Since
    the apostolic age many other attempts to spread
    the gospel have been made, which have been
    considerably successful, notwithstanding which a
    very considerable part of mankind are still involved
    in all the darkness of heathenism. Some
    attempts are still making, but they are inconsiderable
    in comparison of what might be done if
    the whole body of Christians entered heartily into
    the spirit of the divine command on this subject.
    Some think little about it, others are unacquainted
    with the state of the world, and others love their
    wealth better than the souls of their fellow-creatures.
</p>
<p>
    In order that the subject may be taken into
    more serious consideration, I shall enquire, whether
    the commission given by our Lord to his
    disciples be not still binding on us,&mdash;take a short
    view of former undertakings,&mdash;give some account
    of the present state of the world, consider the
    practicability of doing something more than is
    done,&mdash;and the duty of Christians in general in
    this matter.

<p class="subhead">
    <i>An Enquiry whether the Commission given by our Lord
    to his Disciples be not still binding on us.</i>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Our Lord Jesus Christ, a little before his
    departure, commissioned his apostles to <i>Go</i>,
    and <i>teach all nations</i>; or, as another evangelist
    expresses it, <i>Go into all the world, and preach the gospel
    to every creature</i>. This commission was as extensive
    as possible, and laid them under obligation
    to disperse themselves into every country of the
    habitable globe, and preach to all the inhabitants,
    without exception, or limitation. They accordingly
    went forth in obedience to the command,
    and the power of God evidently wrought with
    them. Many attempts of the same kind have
    been made since their day, and which have been
    attended with various success; but the work has
    not been taken up, or prosecuted of late years
    (except by a few individuals) with that zeal and
    perseverance with which the primitive Christians
    went about it. It seems as if many thought the
    commission was sufficiently put in execution by
    what the apostles and others have done; that we
    have enough to do to attend to the salvation of
    our own countrymen; and that, if God intends
    the salvation of the heathen, he will some way or
    other bring them to the gospel, or the gospel to
    them. It is thus that multitudes sit at ease, and
    give themselves no concern about the far greater
    part of their fellow-sinners, who to this day,
    are lost in ignorance and idolatry. There seems
    also to be an opinion existing in the minds of
    some, that because the apostles were extraordinary
    officers and have no proper successors, and because
    many things which were right for them to
    do would be utterly unwarrantable for us, therefore
    it may not be immediately binding on us to
    execute the commission, though it was so upon
    them. To the consideration of such persons I
    would offer the following observations.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="sc">First</span>, If the command of Christ to teach all
    nations be restricted to the apostles, or those under
    the immediate inspiration of the Holy Ghost, then
    that of baptizing should be so too; and every
    denomination of Christians, except the Quakers,
    do wrong in baptizing with water at all.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="sc">Secondly</span>, If the command of Christ to teach
    all nations be confined to the apostles, then all
    such ordinary ministers who have endeavoured to
    carry the gospel to the heathens, have acted without
    a warrant, and run before they were sent.
    Yea, and though God has promised the most
    glorious things to the heathen world by sending
    his gospel to them, yet whoever goes first, or indeed
    at all, with that message, unless he have a
    new and special commission from heaven, must
    go without any authority for so doing.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="sc">Thirdly</span>, If the command of Christ to teach
    all nations extend only to the apostles, then,
    doubtless, the promise of the divine presence in
    this work must be so limited; but this is worded
    in such a manner as expressly precludes such an
    idea. <i>Lo, I am with you always, to the end of the
    world.</i>
</p>
<p>
    That there are cases in which even a divine
    command may cease to be binding is admitted&mdash;As
    for instance, if it be <i>repealed</i>, as the ceremonial
    commandments of the jewish law; or if there be
    <i>no subjects</i> in the world for the commanded act to
    be exercised upon, as in the law of septennial release,
    which might be dispensed with when there
    should be no poor in the land to have their debts
    forgiven. Deut. xv. 4. or if, in any particular
    instance, we can produce a <i>counter-revelation</i>, of
    equal authority with the original command, as
    when Paul and Silas were forbidden of the Holy
    Ghost to preach the word in Bythinia. Acts xvi.
    6. 7. or if, in any case, there be a <i>natural impossibility</i>
    of putting it in execution. It was not the
    duty of Paul to preach Christ to the inhabitants
    of Otaheite, because no such place was then discovered,
    nor had he any means of coming at
    them. But none of these things can be alledged
    by us in behalf of the neglect of the commission
    given by Christ. We cannot say that it is repealed,
    like the commands of the ceremonial law;
    nor can we plead that there are no objects for the
    command to be exercised upon. Alas! the far
    greater part of the world, as we shall see presently,
    are still covered with heathen darkness! Nor can
    we produce a counter-revelation, concerning any
    particular nation, like that to Paul and Silas, concerning
    Bythinia; and, if we could, it would not
    warrant our sitting still and neglecting all the
    other parts of the world; for Paul and Silas, when
    forbidden to preach to those heathens, went elsewhere,
    and preached to others. Neither can we
    alledge a natural impossibility in the case. It has
    been said that we ought not to force our way, but
    to wait for the openings, and leadings of Providence;
    but it might with equal propriety be
    answered in this case, neither ought we to neglect
    embracing those openings in providence which
    daily present themselves to us. What openings
    of providence do we wait for? We can neither
    expect to be transported into the heathen world
    without ordinary means, nor to be endowed with
    the gift of tongues, &amp;c. when we arrive there.
    These would not be providential interpositions,
    but miraculous ones. Where a command exists
    nothing can be necessary to render it binding
    but a removal of those obstacles which render
    obedience impossible, and these are removed
    already.  Natural impossibility can never be
    pleaded so long as facts exist to prove the contrary.
    Have not the popish missionaries surmounted all
    those difficulties which we have generally thought
    to be insuperable? Have not the missionaries of
    the <i>Unitas Fratrum</i>, or Moravian Brethren,
    encountered the scorching heat of Abyssinia, and
    the frozen climes of Greenland, and Labrador,
    their difficult languages, and savage manners?
    Or have not English traders, for the sake of gain,
    surmounted all those things which have generally
    been counted insurmountable obstacles in the
    way of preaching the gospel? Witness the trade
    to Persia, the East-Indies, China, and Greenland,
    yea even the accursed Slave-Trade on the coasts
    of Africa. Men can insinuate themselves into
    the favour of the most barbarous clans, and
    uncultivated tribes, for the sake of gain; and how
    different soever the circumstances of trading and
    preaching are, yet this will prove the possibility
    of ministers being introduced there; and if this
    is but thought a sufficient reason to make the
    experiment, my point is gained.
</p>
<p>
    It has been said that some learned divines
    have proved from Scripture that the time is not
    yet come that the heathen should be converted;
    and that first the <i>witnesses must be slain</i>, and many
    other prophecies fulfilled. But admitting this to
    be the case (which I much doubt<a href="#note-1"><small><sup>1</sup></small></a>) yet if any
    objection is made from this against preaching to
    them immediately, it must be founded on one of
    these things; either that the secret purpose of
    God is the rule of our duty, and then it must be
    as bad to pray for them, as to preach to them;
    or else that none shall be converted in the heathen
    world till the universal down-pouring of the
    Spirit in the last days. But this objection comes
    too late; for the success of the gospel has been
    very considerable in many places already.

</p>
<p>
    It has been objected that there are multitudes
    in our own nation, and within our immediate
    spheres of action, who are as ignorant as the
    South-Sea savages, and that therefore we have
    work enough at home, without going into other
    countries. That there are thousands in our own
    land as far from God as possible, I readily grant,
    and that this ought to excite us to ten-fold diligence
    in our work, and in attempts to spread
    divine knowledge amongst them is a certain fact;
    but that it ought to supercede all attempts to
    spread the gospel in foreign parts seems to want
    proof. Our own countrymen have the means of
    grace, and may attend on the word preached if
    they chuse it. They have the means of knowing
    the truth, and faithful ministers are placed in
    almost every part of the land, whose spheres of
    action might be much extended if their congregations
    were but more hearty and active in the
    cause: but with them the case is widely different,
    who have no Bible, no written language, (which
    many of them have not,) no ministers, no good
    civil government, nor any of those advantages
    which we have. Pity therefore, humanity, and
    much more Christianity, call loudly for every
    possible exertion to introduce the gospel amongst
    them.

    SECT. II.
</h2>
<p class="subhead">
    <i>Containing a short Review of former Undertakings for
    the Conversion of the Heathen.</i>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Before the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
    the whole world were either heathens, or
    jews; and both, as to the body of them were
    enemies to the gospel. After the resurrection the
    disciples continued in Jerusalem till Pentecost.
    Being daily engaged in prayer and supplication,
    and having chosen Matthias, to supply the place
    of Judas in the apostolic office, on that solemn
    day, when they were all assembled together, a
    most remarkable effusion of the Holy Spirit took
    place, and a capacity of speaking in all foreign
    languages was bestowed upon them. This opportunity
    was embraced by Peter for preaching the
    gospel to a great congregation of jews and proselytes,
    who were from Parthia, Media, Elam,
    Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, the proconsular
    Asia, Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, Lybia, Crete,
    Arabia, Rome, &amp;c. and at the first effort God
    wrought so powerfully that three thousand were
    converted, who immediately after were baptized,
    and added to the church.  Before this great
    addition they consisted of but about <i>an hundred
    and twenty persons</i>, but from that time they continually
    increased. It was but a little after this
    that Peter and John, going up to the temple,
    healed the lame man; this miracle drew a great
    multitude together, and Peter took occasion while
    they stood wondering at the event, to preach
    Jesus Christ to them. The consequence was that
    five thousand more believed.
</p>
<p>
    This was not done without opposition; the
    priests and sadducees tried all the methods they
    could invent to prevent them from preaching the
    gospel. The apostles, however, asserted their
    divine warrant, and as soon as they were set at
    liberty addressed God, and prayed that a divine
    power might attend their labours, which petition
    was heard, and their future ministry was very
    successful. On account of their necessities who
    were engaged in this good work, those amongst
    them who had possessions, or goods, sold them,
    and devoted the money to pious uses.
</p>
<p>
    About this time a man and his wife out of
    great pretensions to piety, sold an estate, and
    brought part of the money to the apostles, pretending
    it to be the whole; for which dissimulation
    both he and his wife, were struck dead by
    the hand of God. This awful catastrophe however
    was the occasion of many more men and
    women being added to the church. The miracles
    wrought by the apostles, and the success attending
    their ministry, stirred up greater envy in the
    priests and sadducees, who imprisoned them;
    from which confinement they were soon liberated
    by an angel; upon which they went immediately
    as they were commanded and preached in the
    temple: here they were seized, and brought before
    the council, where Gamaliel spake in their
    favour, and they were dismissed. After this they
    continued to prosecute their work, rejoicing that
    they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the
    name of Christ.
</p>
<p>
    By this time the church at Jerusalem was so
    increased that the multiplicity of its temporal concerns
    was the occasion of some neglects, which
    produced a dissatisfaction. The apostles, therefore,
    recommended to the church to chuse seven
    pious men, whose office it should be to attend
    upon its temporal affairs; that <i>they might give
    themselves to prayer, and the ministry of the word</i>.
    Seven were accordingly chosen, over whom the
    apostles prayed, and ordained them to the office
    of Deacons by imposition of hands: and these
    things being settled the church increased more
    and more. One of these Deacons, whose name
    was Stephen, being a person of eminent knowledge
    and holiness, wrought many miracles, and
    disputed with great evidence and energy for the
    truth of Christianity, which raised him up a
    number of opponents. These soon procured his
    death, and carried their resentment so far as to
    stir up such a persecution that the church, which
    till now had been confined to Jerusalem, was dispersed,
    and all the preachers except the apostles
    were driven thence, and went every where
    preaching the word.
</p>
<p>
    A young man whose name was <i>Saul</i>, was very
    active in this persecution; he had been educated
    under Gamaliel, a member of the Sanhedrim,
    was a person of promising genius, by profession a
    Pharisee, and much attached to the jewish ceremonies.
    When Stephen was stoned he appeared
    much pleased with it, and had the custody of
    the clothes of his executioners; and from that
    time was fired with such a spirit of persecution
    himself, that he went about dragging some to
    prison, and compelling others to blaspheme the
    name of the Lord Jesus. Neither was he contented
    with exercising his rage at Jerusalem, but
    went to the chief priests and obtained testimonials
    of authority to carry on the same work at Damascus.
    But on his way, as he was almost ready to
    enter into the city, the Lord changed his heart in
    a very wonderful manner; so that instead of entering
    the town to persecute, he began to preach
    the gospel as soon as be was able. This presently
    brought upon him the same persecution which he
    had designed to exercise upon others, and even
    endangered his life, so that the brethren found it
    necessary to let him down the city wall in a
    basket by night, and so he escaped the hands of
    his enemies. From thence he went to Jerusalem
    where he preached the word, but being persecuted
    there, he went to Cesarea, and from thence to
    Tarsus.
</p>
<p>
    In the time of this trouble in the church,
    Philip went and preached at Samaria with great
    success, nay so great was the work that an impostor,
    who had deceived the people with legerdemain
    tricks for a long time was so amazed, and
    even convinced, as to profess himself a Christian,
    and was baptized; but was afterwards detected,
    and appeared to be an hypocrite. Besides him a
    great number believed in reality, and being baptized
    a church was formed there. Soon after this
    the Lord commanded Philip to go the way which
    led from Jerusalem to Gaza, which he did, and
    there found an eunuch of great authority in the
    court of Ethiopia, to whom he preached Christ,
    who believed, and was baptized; after which
    Philip preached at Ashdod, or Azotus.
</p>
<p>
    About the same time Peter went to Lydda, or
    Diospolis, and cured Eneas of a palsy, which was
    a mean of the conversion not only of the inhabitants
    of that town, but also of the neighbouring
    country, called Saron, the capital of which was
    Lasharon; and while he was there, a circumstance
    turned up which tended much to the spread of
    the truth. A woman of Joppa, a sea-port town
    in the neighbourhood, dying, they sent to Lydda
    for Peter, who went over, and when he had
    prayed she was raised to life again; which was an
    occasion of the conversion of many in that town.
    Peter continued there preaching for some time,
    and lodged at the house of a tanner.
</p>
<p>
    Now another circumstance also tended to the
    further propogation of Christianity, for a Roman
    military officer who had some acquaintance with
    the Old Testament Scriptures, but was not circumcised,
    was one day engaged in prayer in his
    house at Cesarea, when an angel appeared to him,
    and bid him send for Peter from Joppa to preach
    in his house. Before this the work of God had
    been wholly confined to the jews, and jewish proselytes,
    and even the apostles appeared to have
    had very contracted ideas of the Christian dispensation;
    but now God by a vision discovered
    to Peter that Christianity was to be spread into
    all nations. He accordingly went and preached
    at the house of Cornelius, at Cesarea, when several
    were converted, and baptized, and the foundation
    of a church laid in that city.
</p>
<p>
    Some of the dispersed ministers having fled to
    Antioch in Syria, began to preach to the greeks
    in that city about the same time, and had good
    success; upon which the apostles sent Paul and
    Barnabas, who instructed and strengthened them,
    and a church was formed in that city also,
    which in a little time sent out several eminent
    preachers.
</p>
<p>
    In the Acts of the apostles we have an account
    of <i>four</i> of the principal journies which Paul, and
    his companions undertook. The first, in which
    he was accompanied by Barnabas, is recorded in
    the xiii. and xiv. chapters, and was the first <i>attack</i>
    on the heathen world. It was a journey into the
    lesser Asia. In their way they passed over the
    island of Cyprus. No sooner had they entered
    on their undertaking, than they met with great
    difficulty; for Mark, whom they had taken as
    their minister, deserted them, and returned to
    Jerusalem, where, it seems, he thought he should
    enjoy the greatest quiet. Paul and Barnabas however
    went forward; in every city they preached
    the word of the Lord, entering into the jewish
    synagogues and first preaching Christ to them,
    and then to the gentiles. They were heard with
    great candour and eagerness by some, and rejected
    by others with obstinacy and wrath, and cruel
    persecution. One while they had enough to do
    to restrain the people from worshipping them as
    gods, and soon after, Paul was stoned, dragged
    out of the city, and left for dead. Having penetrated
    as far as Derbe, they thought proper to
    return by the way that they came, calling at every
    city where they had sown the good seed, and
    finding in most, if not all these places, some
    who had embraced the gospel, they exhorted and
    strengthened them in the faith, formed them into
    a church state, and ordained them elders, fasted
    and prayed with them; and so having commended
    them to the Lord on whom they had
    believed, returned to Antioch in Syria, from
    whence they first set out, and rehearsed to the
    church all that God had done with them, and
    how he had opened the door of faith to the
    gentiles.
</p>
<p>
    About this time a dispute arising in the
    churches concerning circumcision, Paul and Barnabas
    were deputed to go up to Jerusalem, to
    consult the apostles and elders on the subject.
    This business being adjusted, they, accompanied
    with Judas and Silas, returned to Antioch with
    the general resolution, and continued there for a
    season, teaching and preaching the word of the
    Lord.
</p>
<p>
    Paul now proposed to Barnabas, his fellow-labourer,
    that they might visit their brethren in
    the places where they had been already, and see
    how they did. To this Barnabas readily acceded,
    but a difference arising between them about
    taking <i>John Mark</i> with them, who had deserted
    them before, these two eminent servants of God
    were parted asunder, and never appear to have
    travelled together any more. They continued
    however each to serve in the cause of Christ,
    though they could not walk together. Barnabas
    took John, and sailed to Cyprus, his native
    island, and Paul took Silas, and went through
    Syria and Cilicia to Derbe and Lystra, cities
    where he and Barnabas had preached in their
    first excursion.
</p>
<p>
    Here they found Timothy, a promising young
    man, whom they encouraged to engage in the
    ministry.
</p>
<p>
    Paul being now at Lystra, which was the
    boundary of his first excursion, and having visited
    the churches already planted, and delivered to
    them the decrees of the apostles and elders relating
    to circumcision, seems to have felt his heart
    enlarged, and assayed to carry on the glorious work
    of preaching the gospel to the heathen to a greater
    extent. With Silas and Timotheus he in his second
    journey<a href="#note-2"><small><sup>2</sup></small></a> took a western direction, passing through
    Phrygia, and the region of Galatia. Having preached
    the word in these parts with considerable success,<a href="#note-3"><small><sup>3</sup></small></a>
    he and his companions wished to have gone into the
    proconsular Asia, and afterwards assayed to go into
    Bythinia; but begin forbidden of the Holy Ghost,
    who seems to have had a special design of
    employing them elsewhere; passing by Mysia they
    came down to Troas on the sea-coast. Here a vision
    appeared to Paul, in which he was invited to go over
    to Macedonia. Obedient to the heavenly vision, and
    greatly encouraged by it, they with all speed crossed
    the Egean Sea, and passing through the island of
    Samothracia, landed at Neapolis, and went from
    thence to Philippi, the chief city of that part of
    Macedonia. It was here that Paul preached on
    a Sabbath day to a few women by a
    river side, and Lydia, a woman of Thyatira, was
    converted and baptized, and her household with her.
    It was here that a poor girl, who brought her
    employers considerable profit by foretelling
    events, followed the apostles, had her spirit of
    divination ejected, on which account her masters
    were much irritated, and raised a tumult, the
    effect of which was, that Paul and Silas were
    imprisoned. But even this was over-ruled for the
    success of the gospel, in that the keeper of the
    prison, and all his house, were thereby brought
    to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and were
    baptized.

</p>
<p>
    From Philippi they passed thorough Amphipolis,
    Apollonia, Thessalonica, (now Salonichi,)
    Berea, Athens, and Corinth, preaching the gospel
    wherever they went. From hence Paul took
    ship and sailed to Syria, only giving a short call
    at Ephesus, determining to be at Jerusalem at
    the feast of the passover; and having saluted the
    church, he came to Cesarea, and from thence to
    Antioch.
</p>
<p>
    Here ended Paul's second journey, which was
    very extensive, and took up some years of his
    time. He and his companions met with their
    difficulties in it, but had likewise their encouragements.
    They were persecuted at Philippi, as
    already noticed, and generally found the Jews to
    be their most inveterate enemies. These would
    raise tumults, inflame the minds of the gentiles
    against them, and follow them from place to
    place, doing them all the mischief in their power.
    This was the case especially at Thessalonica, Berea,
    and Corinth. But amidst all their persecutions
    God was with them, and strengthened them in
    various ways. At Berea they were candidly received,
    and their doctrine fairly tried by the
    Holy Scriptures; and <i>therefore</i>, it is said, <i>many of
    them believed</i>. At other places, though they affected
    to despise the apostle, yet some clave unto him.
    At <i>Corinth</i> opposition rose to a great height; but
    the Lord appeared to his servant in a vision, saying,
    <i>Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace,
    for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt
    thee; for I have much people in this city</i>. And the
    promise was abundantly made good in the spirit
    discovered by Gallio, the proconsul, who turned
    a deaf ear to the accusations of the jews, and
    nobly declined interfering in matters beside his
    province. Upon the whole a number of churches
    were planted during this journey, which for ages
    after shone as lights in the world.
</p>
<p>
    When Paul had visited Antioch, and spent
    some time there, he prepared for a third journey
    into heathen countries, the account of which
    begins Acts xviii. 23. and ends chap. xxi. 17. At
    his first setting out he went over the whole country
    of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all
    the disciples; and passing through the upper coasts
    came to Ephesus. There for the space of three
    months, he boldly preached in the jewish synagogue,
    disputing, and persuading the things concerning
    the kingdom of God. But when the
    hardened jews had openly rejected the gospel, and
    spake evil of that way before the multitude, Paul
    openly separated the disciples from them, and
    assembled in the school of one Tyrannus. This,
    it is said, continued for the space of two years,
    <i>so that all they who dwelt in</i> the proconsular <i>Asia
    heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both jews and greeks</i>.
    Certain magicians, about this time were exposed,
    and others converted, who burnt their books, and
    confessed their deeds. So mightily grew the word
    of the Lord, and prevailed.
</p>
<p>
    After this an uproar being raised by Demetrius,
    the silversmith, Paul went into Macedonia, visited
    the churches planted in his former journey, and
    from thence passed into Greece. Having preached
    up and down for three months, he thought of
    sailing from thence directly to Syria; but in
    order to avoid the jews, who laid wait for him
    near the sea coast, he took another course through
    Macedonia, and from thence to Troas, by the
    way of Philippi. There is no mention made in
    his former journey of his having preached at
    Troas; yet it seems he did, and a church was
    gathered, with whom the apostle at this time
    united in <i>breaking of bread</i>. It was here that he
    preached all night, and raised Eutychus, who
    being overcome with sleep, had fallen down, and
    was taken up dead. From hence they set sail for
    Syria, and in their way called at Miletus, where
    Paul sent for the elders of the church of Ephesus,
    and delivered that most solemn and affectionate
    farewell, recorded in the 20th chapter of the Acts
    of the Apostles. From hence they sailed for
    Tyre, where they tarried seven days, and from
    thence proceeded to Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>
    Paul's fourth and last journey (or rather voyage)
    was to Rome, where he went in the character
    of a prisoner. For being at Jerusalem he was
    quickly apprehended by the jews; but being
    rescued by Lysias, the chief captain, he was sent
    to Cesarea to take his trial. Here he made his
    defence before Felix and Drusilla, in such sort
    that the judge, instead of the prisoner, was made
    to tremble.  Here also he made his defence
    before Festus, Agrippa, and Bernice, with such
    force of evidence that Agrippa was almost persuaded
    to be a Christian. But the malice of the
    jews being insatiable, and Paul finding himself in
    danger of being delivered into their hands, was
    constrained to appeal unto Caesar. This was the
    occasion of his being sent to Rome, where he
    arrived after a long and dangerous voyage, and
    being shipwrecked on the island of Melita, where
    he wrought miracles, and Publius, the governor,
    was converted.
</p>
<p>
    When he arrived at Rome he addressed his
    countrymen the jews, some of whom believed;
    but when others rejected the gospel, he turned
    from them to the gentiles, and for two whole
    years dwelt in his own hired house preaching the
    kingdom of God, and teaching those things which
    concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence,
    no man forbidding him.
</p>
<p>
    Thus far the history of the Acts of the Apostles
    informs us of the success of the word in the
    primitive times; and history informs us of its
    being preached about this time, in many other
    places. Peter speaks of a church at Babylon;
    Paul proposed a journey to Spain, and it is generally
    believed he went there, and likewise came
    to France and Britain. Andrew preached to the
    Scythians, north of the Black Sea. John is said
    to have preached in India, and we know that he
    was at the Isle of Patmos, in the Archipelago.
    Philip is reported to have preached in upper Asia,
    Scythia, and Phrygia; Bartholomew in India, on
    this side the Ganges, Phrygia, and Armenia;
    Matthew in Arabia, or Asiatic Ethiopia, and
    Parthia; Thomas in India, as far as the coast of
    Coromandel, and some say in the island of Ceylon;
    Simon, the Canaanite, in Egypt, Cyrene,
    Mauritania, Lybia, and other parts of Africa, and
    from thence to have come to Britain; and Jude
    is said to have been principally engaged in the
    lesser Asia, and Greece. Their labours were
    evidently very extensive, and very successful; so
    that Pliny, the younger, who lived soon after the
    death of the apostles, in a letter to the emperor,
    Trajan, observed that Christianity had spread, not
    only through towns and cities, but also through
    whole countries. Indeed before this, in the time
    of Nero, it was so prevalent that it was thought
    necessary to oppose it by an Imperial Edict, and
    accordingly the proconsuls, and other governors,
    were commissioned to destroy it.
</p>
<p>
    Justin Martyr, who lived about the middle of
    the second century, in his dialogue with Trypho,
    observed that there was no part of mankind, whether
    greeks or barbarians, or any others, by what
    name soever they were called, whether the Sarmatians,
    or the Nomades, who had no houses,
    or the Scenites of Arabia Petrea, who lived in
    tents among their cattle, where supplications and
    thanksgivings are not offered up to the Father, and
    maker of all things, through the name of Jesus
    Christ. Irenaeus, who lived about the year 170,
    speaks of churches that were founded in Germany,
    Spain, France, the eastern countries, Egypt, Lybia,
    and the middle of the world. Tertullian,
    who lived and wrote at Carthage in Africa, about
    twenty years afterwards, enumerating the countries
    where Christianity had penetrated, makes
    mention of the Parthians, Medes, Elamites, Mesopotamians,
    Armenians, Phrygians, Cappadocians,
    the inhabitants of Pontus, Asia, Pamphylia,
    Egypt, and the regions of Africa beyond Cyrene,
    the Romans, and Jews, formerly of Jerusalem,
    many of the Getuli, many borders of the Mauri,
    or Moors, in Mauritania; now Barbary, Morocco,
    &amp;c. all the borders of Spain, many nations of the
    Gauls, and the places in Britain which were inaccessible
    to the Romans; the Dacians, Sarmatians,
    Germans, Scythians, and the inhabitants
    of many hidden nations and provinces, and of
    many islands unknown to him, and which he
    could not enumerate. The labours of the ministers
    of the gospel, in this early period, were so
    remarkably blessed of God, that the last mentioned
    writer observed, in a letter to Scapula, that if he
    began a persecution the city of Carthage itself
    must be decimated thereby. Yea, and so abundant
    were they in the three first centuries, that ten
    years constant and almost universal persecution
    under Dioclesian, could neither root out the
    Christians, nor prejudice their cause.
</p>
<p>
    After this they had great encouragement under
    several emperors, particularly Constantine and
    Theodosius, and a very great work of God was
    carried on; but the ease and affluence which in
    these times attended the church, served to introduce
    a flood of corruption, which by degrees
    brought on the whole system of popery, by means
    of which all appeared to be lost again; and Satan
    set up his kingdom of darkness, deceit, and human
    authority over conscience, through all the
    Christian world.
</p>
<p>
    In the time of Constantine, one Frumentius
    was sent to preach to the Indians, and met with
    great success. A young woman who was a Christian,
    being taken captive by the Iberians, or
    Georgians, near the Caspian Sea, informed them
    of the truths of Christianity, and was so much regarded
    that they sent to Constantine for ministers
    to come and preach the word to them. About
    the same time some barbarous nations having
    made irruptions into Thrace, carried away several
    Christians captive, who preached the gospel; by
    which means the inhabitants upon the Rhine,
    and the Danube, the Celtae, and some other parts
    of Gaul, were brought to embrace Christianity.
    About this time also James of Nisbia, went into
    Persia to strengthen the Christians, and preach to
    the heathens; and his success was so great that
    Adiabene was almost entirely Christian. About
    the year 372, one Moses, a Monk, went to preach
    to the Saracens, who then lived in Arabia, where
    he had great success; and at this time the Goths,
    and other northern nations, had the kingdom of
    Christ further extended amongst them, but which
    was very soon corrupted with Arianism.
</p>
<p>
    Soon after this the kingdom of Christ was
    further extended among the Scythian Nomades,
    beyond the Danube, and about the year 430, a
    people called the Burgundians, received the gospel.
    Four years after, that Palladius was sent to
    preach in Scotland, and the next year Patrick was
    sent from Scotland to preach to the Irish who
    before his time were totally uncivilized, and,
    some say, cannibals; he however, was useful,
    and laid the foundations of several churches in
    Ireland. Presently after this, truth spread further
    among the Saracens, and in 522, Zathus, king of
    the Colchians encouraged it, and many of that
    nation were converted to Christianity. About
    this time also the work was extended in Ireland,
    by Finian, and in Scotland by Constantine and
    Columba; the latter of whom preached also to
    the Picts, and Brudaeus, their king, with several
    others, were converted. About 541, Adad, the
    king of Ethiopia, was converted by the preaching
    of Mansionarius; the Heruli beyond the Danube,
    were now made obedient to the faith, and the
    Abasgi, near the Caucasian Mountains.
</p>
<p>
    But now popery, especially the compulsive part
    of it, was risen to such an height, that the usual
    method of propagating the gospel, or rather what
    was so called, was to conquer pagan nations by
    force of arms, and then oblige them to submit to
    Christianity, after which bishopricks were erected,
    and persons then sent to instruct the people. I
    shall just mention some of those who are said to
    have laboured thus.
</p>
<p>
    In 596, Austin, the monk, Melitus, Justus,
    Paulinus, and Russinian, laboured in England,
    and in their way were very successful. Paulinus,
    who appears to have been one of the best of them,
    had great success in Northumberland; Birinnius
    preached to the West Saxons, and Felix to the
    East Angles. In 589, Amandus Gallus laboured
    in Ghent, Chelenus in Artois, and Gallus and
    Columbanus in Suabia. In 648, Egidius Gallus
    in Flanders, and the two Evaldi, in Westphalia.
    In 684, Willifred, in the Isle of Wight. In 688,
    Chilianus, in upper Franconia. In 698, Boniface,
    or Winifred, among the Thuringians, near
    Erford, in Saxony, and Willibroad in West-Friesland.
    Charlemagne conquered Hungary in the
    year 800, and obliged the inhabitants to profess
    Christianity, when Modestus likewise preached to
    the Venedi, at the source of the Save and Drave.
    In 833, Ansgarius preached in Denmark, Gaudibert
    in Sweden, and about 861, Methodius and
    Cyril, in Bohemia.
</p>
<p>
    About the year 500, the Scythians over-run Bulgaria,
    and Christianity was extirpated; but about
    870 they were re-converted. Poland began to
    be brought over about the same time, and afterwards,
    about 960 or 990, the work was further
    extended amongst the Poles and Prussians. The
    work was begun in Norway in 960, and in Muscovy
    in 989, the Swedes propagated Christianity
    in Finland, in 1168, Lithuania became Christian
    in 1386, and Samogitia in 1439. The Spaniards
    forced popery upon the inhabitants of South-America,
    and the Portuguese in Asia.  The
    Jesuits were sent into China in 1552. Xavier,
    whom they call the apostle of the Indians, laboured
    in the East-Indies and Japan, from 1541
    to 1552, and several millions of Capauchins
    were sent to Africa in the seventeenth century.
    But blind zeal, gross superstition, and infamous
    cruelties, so marked the appearances of religion
    all this time, that the professors of Christianity
    needed conversion, as much as the heathen
    world.
</p>
<p>
    A few pious people had fled from the general
    corruption, and lived obscurely in the vallies of
    Piedmont and Savoy, who were like the seed of
    the church. Some of them were now and then
    necessitated to travel into other parts, where they
    faithfully testified against the corruptions of the
    times. About 1369 Wickliffe began to preach
    the faith in England, and his preaching and
    writings were the means of the conversion of
    great numbers, many of whom became excellent
    preachers; and a work was begun which afterwards
    spread in England, Hungary, Bohemia,
    Germany, Switzerland, and many other places.
    John Huss and Jerom of Prague, preached boldly
    and successfully in Bohemia, and the adjacent
    parts. In the following century Luther, Calvin,
    Melancton, Bucer, Martyr, and many others,
    stood up against all the rest of the world; they
    preached, and prayed, and wrote; and nations
    agreed one after another to cast off the yoke of
    popery, and to embrace the doctrine of the
    gospel.
</p>
<p>
    In England, episcopal tyranny succeeded to
    popish cruelty, which, in the year 1620, obliged
    many pious people to leave their native land
    and settle in America; these were followed by
    others in 1629, who laid the foundations of
    several gospel churches, which have increased
    amazingly since that time, and the Redeemer has
    fixed his throne in that country, where but a
    little time ago, Satan had universal dominion.
</p>
<p>
    In 1632, Mr. Elliot, of New-England, a very
    pious and zealous minister, began to preach to
    the Indians, among whom he had great success;
    several churches of Indians were planted, and some
    preachers and school-masters raised up amongst
    them; since which time others have laboured
    amongst them with some good encouragement.
    About the year 1743, Mr. David Brainerd was
    sent a missionary to some more Indians, where
    he preached, and prayed, and after some time an
    extraordinary work of conversion was wrought,
    and wonderful success attended his ministry.
    And at this present time, Mr. Kirkland and Mr.
    Sergeant are employed in the same good work,
    and God has considerably blessed their labours.

    In 1706, the king of Denmark sent a Mr.
    Ziegenbalg, and some others, to Tranquebar, on
    the Coromandel coast in the East-Indies, who
    were useful to the natives, so that many of the
    heathens were turned to the Lord. The Dutch
    East-India Company likewise having extended
    their commerce, built the city of Batavia, and a
    church was opened there; and the Lord's Supper
    was administered for the first time, on the 3d of
    January, 1621, by their minister James Hulzibos,
    from hence some ministers were sent to Amboyna,
    who were very successful. A seminary of learning
    was erected at Leyden, in which ministers and
    assistants were educated, under the renowned
    <i>Walaeus</i>, and some years a great number were sent
    to the East, at the Company's expence, so that in
    a little time many thousands at Formosa, Malabar,
    Ternate, Jaffanapatnam, in the town of Columba,
    at Amboyna, Java, Banda, Macassar, and Malabar,
    embraced the religion of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    The work has decayed in some places, but they
    now have churches in Ceylon, Sumatra, Java,
    Amboyna, and some other of the spice islands,
    and at the Cape of Good Hope, in Africa.
</p>
<p>
    But none of the moderns have equalled the
    Moravian Brethren in this good work; they have
    sent missions to Greenland, Labrador, and several
    of the West-Indian Islands, which have been
    blessed for good. They have likewise sent to
    Abyssinia, in Africa, but what success they have
    had I cannot tell.
</p>
<p>
    The late Mr. Wesley lately made an effort in
    the West-Indies, and some of their ministers are
    now labouring amongst the Caribbs and Negroes,
    and I have seen pleasing accounts of their
    success.

<p class="subhead">
    <i>Containing a Survey of the present State of the
    World.</i>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    In this survey I shall consider the world as
    divided, according to its usual division, into
    four parts, <i>EUROPE, ASIA, AFRICA</i>, and
    <i>AMERICA</i>, and take notice of the extent of the
    several countries, their population, civilization,
    and religion. The article of religion I shall
    divide into Christian, Jewish, Mahometan, and
    Pagan; and shall now and then hint at the particular
    sect of them that prevails in the places
    which I shall describe. The following Tables
    will exhibit a more comprehensive view of what
    I propose, than any thing I can offer on the
    subject.

<p>
    This, as nearly as I can obtain information,
    is the state of the world; though in many
    countries, as Turkey, Arabia, Great Tartary,
    Africa, and America, except the United States,
    and most of the Asiatic Islands, we have no
    accounts of the number of inhabitants, that can
    be relied on. I have therefore only calculated
    the extent, and counted a certain number on an
    average upon a square mile; in some countries
    more, and in others less, according as circumstances
    determine. A few general remarks upon
    it will conclude this section.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="sc">First</span>, the inhabitants of the world according
    to this calculation, amount to about seven hundred
    and thirty-one millions; four hundred and
    twenty millions of whom are still in pagan darkness;
    an hundred and thirty millions the followers
    of Mahomet; an hundred millions catholics;
    forty-four millions protestants; thirty millions of
    the greek and armenian churches, and perhaps
    seven millions of jews. It must undoubtedly
    strike every considerate mind, what a vast proportion
    of the sons of Adam there are, who yet
    remain in the most deplorable state of heathen
    darkness, without any means of knowing the true
    God, except what are afforded them by the works
    of nature; and utterly destitute of the knowledge
    of the gospel of Christ, or of any means of
    obtaining it. In many of these countries they
    have no written language, consequently no Bible,
    and are only led by the most childish customs and
    traditions. Such, for instance, are all the middle
    and back parts of North America,  the inland
    parts of South America, the South-Sea Islands,
    New Holland, New Zealand, New Guinea; and
    I may add Great Tartary, Siberia, Samojedia,
    and the other parts of Asia contiguous to the
    frozen sea; the greatest part of Africa, the island
    of Madagascar, and many places beside. In
    many of these parts also they are cannibals, feeding
    upon the flesh of their slain enemies, with the
    greatest brutality and eagerness. The truth of
    this was ascertained, beyond a doubt, by the late
    eminent navigator, Cooke, of the New Zealanders,
    and some of the inhabitants of the western coast
    of America. Human sacrifices are also very frequently
    offered, so that scarce a week elapses without
    instances of this kind. They are in general
    poor, barbarous, naked pagans, as destitute of
    civilization, as they are of true religion.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="sc">Secondly</span>, barbarous as these poor heathens
    are, they appear to be as capable of knowledge as
    we are; and in many places, at least, have discovered
    uncommon genius and tractableness; and
    I greatly question whether most of the barbarities
    practiced by them, have not originated in some
    real or supposed affront, and are therefore, more
    properly, acts of self-defence, than proofs of inhuman
    and blood-thirsty dispositions.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="sc">Thirdly</span>, in other parts, where they have a
    written language, as in the East-Indies, China,
    Japan, &amp;c. they know nothing of the gospel.
    The jesuits indeed once made many converts to
    popery among the Chinese; but their highest aim
    seemed to be to obtain their good opinion; for
    though the converts professed themselves Christians,
    yet they were allowed to honour the image
    of <span class="sc">Confucius</span> their great law-giver; and at length
    their ambitious intrigues brought upon them the
    displeasure of government, which terminated in
    the suppression of the mission, and almost, if not
    entirely, of the Christian name. It is also a melancholy
    fact, that the vices of Europeans have
    been communicated wherever they themselves
    have been; so that the religious state of even heathens
    has been rendered worse by intercourse
    with them!
</p>
<p>
    <span class="sc">Fourthly</span>, a very great proportion of Asia and
    Africa, with some part of Europe, are <i>Mahometans</i>;
    and those in Persia, who are of the sect of <i>Hali</i>,
    are the most inveterate enemies to the Turks;
    and they in return abhor the Persians. The
    Africans are some of the most ignorant of all the
    mahometans; especially the Arabs, who are scattered
    through all the northern parts of Africa, and
    live upon the depredations which they are continually
    making upon their neighbours.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="sc">Fifthly</span>, in respect to those who bear the
    Christian name, a very great degree of ignorance
    and immorality abounds amongst them. There
    are Christians, so called, of the greek and armenian
    churches, in all the mahometan countries; but
    they are, if possible, more ignorant and vicious
    than the mahometans themselves. The Georgian
    Christians, who are near the Caspian Sea, maintain
    themselves by selling their neighbours, relations,
    and children, for slaves to the Turks and
    Persians. And it is remarked, that if any of the
    greeks of Anatolia  turn  mussulmen, the Turks
    never set any store by them, on account of their
    being so much noted for dissimulation and hypocrisy.
    It is well known that most of the members
    of the greek church are very ignorant. Papists
    also are in general ignorant of divine things, and
    very vicious. Nor do the bulk of the church of
    England much exceed them, either in knowledge
    or holiness; and many errors, and much looseness
    of conduct, are to be found amongst dissenters of
    all denominations. The lutherans in Denmark,
    are much on a par with the ecclesiastics in England;
    and the face of most Christian countries
    presents a dreadful scene of ignorance, hypocrisy,
    and profligacy. Various baneful, and pernicious
    errors appear to gain ground, in almost every
    part of Christendom; the truths of the gospel,
    and even the gospel itself, are attacked, and every
    method that the enemy can invent is employed
    to undermine the kingdom of our Lord Jesus
    Christ.
</p>
<p>
    All these things are loud calls to Christians,
    and especially to ministers, to exert themselves to
    the utmost in their several spheres of action, and
    to try to enlarge them as much as possible.

<h2>
    SECT. IV.
</h2>
<p class="subhead">
    <i>The Practicability of something being done, more than
    what is done, for the Conversion of the Heathen.</i>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    The impediments in the way of carrying
    the gospel among the heathen must arise, I
    think, from one or other of the following things;
    &mdash;either their distance from us, their barbarous
    and savage manner of living, the danger of being
    killed by them, the difficulty of procuring the
    necessaries of life, or the unintelligibleness of their
    languages.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="sc">First</span>, as to their distance from us, whatever
    objections might have been made on that account
    before the invention of the mariner's compass,
    nothing can be alledged for it, with any colour of
    plausibility in the present age.   Men can now sail
    with as much certainty through the Great South
    Sea, as they can through the Mediterranean, or
    any lesser Sea.   Yea, and providence seems in a
    manner to invite us to the trial, as there are to our
    knowledge trading companies, whose commerce
    lies in many of the places where, these barbarians
    dwell. At one time or other ships are sent to
    visit places of more recent discovery, and to
    explore parts the most unknown; and every fresh
    account of their ignorance, or cruelty, should call
    forth our pity, and excite us to concur with providence
    in seeking their eternal good. Scripture
    likewise seems to point out this method, <i>Surely the
    Isles shall wait for me; the ships of Tarshish first, to
    bring my sons from far, their silver, and their gold with
    them, unto the name of the Lord, thy God.</i> Isai. lx. 9.
    This seems to imply that in the time of the
    glorious increase of the church, in the latter days,
    (of which the whole chapter is undoubtedly a
    prophecy,) commerce shall subserve the spread of
    the gospel. The ships of Tarshish were trading
    vessels, which made voyages for traffic to various
    parts; thus much therefore must be meant by it,
    that <i>navigation</i>, especially that which is <i>commercial</i>,
    shall be one great mean of carrying on the work
    of God;  and perhaps it may imply that there
    shall be a very considerable appropriation of
    wealth to that purpose.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="sc">Secondly</span>, as to their uncivilized, and barbarous
    way of living, this can be no objection to
    any, except those whose love of ease renders
    them unwilling to expose themselves to inconveniencies
    for the good of others.
</p>
<p>
    It was no objection to the apostles and their
    successors, who went among the barbarous <i>Germans</i>
    and <i>Gauls</i>, and still more barbarous <i>Britons</i>!
    They did not wait for the ancient inhabitants of
    these countries, to be civilized, before they could
    be christianized, but went simply with the doctrine
    of the cross; and <span class="sc">Tertullian</span> could boast that
    "those parts of Britain which were proof against
    the Roman armies, were conquered by the gospel
    of Christ"&mdash;It was no objection to an <span class="sc">Elliot</span>, or
    a <span class="sc">Brainerd</span>, in later times. They went forth,
    and encountered every difficulty of the kind, and
    found that a cordial reception of the gospel produced
    those happy effects which the longest intercourse
    with Europeans, without it could never
    accomplish. It <i>is</i> no objection to commercial
    men. It only requires that we should have as
    much love to the souls of our fellow-creatures,
    and fellow sinners, as they have for the profits
    arising from a few otter-skins, and all these difficulties
    would be easily surmounted.
</p>
<p>
    After all, the uncivilized state of the heathen,
    instead of affording an objection <i>against</i> preaching
    the gospel to them, ought to furnish an argument
    <i>for</i> it. Can we as men, or as christians, hear that
    a great part of our fellow creatures, whose souls
    are as immortal as ours, and who are as capable
    as ourselves, of adorning the gospel, and contributing
    by their preaching, writings, or practices
    to the glory of our Redeemer's name, and the
    good of his church, are inveloped in ignorance
    and barbarism? Can we hear that they are without
    the gospel, without government, without laws,
    and without arts, and sciences; and not exert
    ourselves to introduce amongst them the sentiments
    of men, and of Christians? Would not the
    spread of the gospel be the most effectual mean
    of their civilization? Would not that make them
    useful members of society? We know that such
    effects did in a measure follow the afore-mentioned
    efforts of <i>Elliot</i>, <i>Brainerd</i>, and others amongst the
    American Indians; and if similar attempts were
    made in other parts of the world, and succeeded
    with a divine blessing (which we have every reason
    to think they would) might we not expect to
    see able Divines, or read well-conducted treatises
    in defence of the truth, even amongst those who
    at present seem to be scarcely human?
</p>
<p>
    <span class="sc">Thirdly</span>, <i>In respect to the danger of being killed
    by them</i>, it is true that whoever does go must put
    his life in his hand, and not consult with flesh
    and blood; but do not the goodness of the cause,
    the duties incumbent on us as the creatures of
    God, and Christians, and the perishing state of
    our fellow men, loudly call upon us to venture
    all and use every warrantable exertion for their
    benefit? <span class="sc">Paul</span> and
<span class="sc">Barnabas</span>, who <i>hazarded their
    lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ</i>, were not
    blamed as being rash, but commended for so
    doing, while <span class="sc">John Mark</span> who through timidity
    of mind deserted them in their perilous undertaking,
    was branded with censure. After all, as has
    been already observed, I greatly question whether
    most of the barbarities practiced by the savages
    upon those who have visited them, have not
    originated in some real or supposed affront, and
    were therefore, more properly, acts of self-defence,
    than proofs of ferocious dispositions. No wonder
    if the imprudence of sailors should prompt them
    to offend the simple savage, and the offence be resented;
    but <i>Elliot</i>, <i>Brainerd</i>, and the <i>Moravian
    missionaries</i>, have been very seldom molested. Nay,
    in general the heathen have shewed a willingness
    to hear the word; and have principally expressed
    their hatred of Christianity on account of the
    vices of nominal Christians.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="sc">Fourthly</span>, <i>As to the difficulty of procuring the
    necessaries of life</i>, this would not be so great as
    may appear at first sight; for though we could
    not procure European food, yet we might procure
    such as the natives of those countries which
    we visit, subsist upon themselves. And this would
    only be passing through what we have virtually
    engaged, in by entering on the ministerial office.
    A Christian minister is a person who in a peculiar
    sense is <i>not his own</i>; he is the <i>servant</i> of God, and
    therefore ought to be wholly devoted to him.
    By entering on that sacred office he solemnly undertakes
    to be always engaged, as much as possible,
    in the Lord's work, and not to chuse his own
    pleasure, or employment, or pursue the ministry
    as a something that is to subserve his own ends,
    or interests, or as a kind of bye-work. He engages
    to go where God pleases, and to do, or endure
    what he sees fit to command, or call him to, in
    the exercise of his function. He virtually bids
    farewell to friends, pleasures, and comforts, and
    stands in readiness to endure the greatest sufferings
    in the work of his Lord, and Master. It is
    inconsistent for ministers to please themselves with
    thoughts of a numerous auditory, cordial friends,
    a civilized country, legal protection, affluence,
    splendor, or even a competency. The flights,
    and hatred of men, and even pretended friends,
    gloomy prisons, and tortures, the society of barbarians
    of uncouth speech, miserable accommodations
    in wretched wildernesses, hunger, and
    thirst, nakedness, weariness, and painfulness, hard
    work, and but little worldly encouragement,
    should rather be the objects of their expectation.
    Thus the apostles acted, in the primitive times,
    and endured hardness, as good soldiers of Jesus
    Christ; and though we living in a civilized country
    where Christianity is protected by law, are
    not called to suffer these things while we continue
    here, yet I question whether all are justified in
    staying here, while so many are perishing without
    means of grace in other lands. Sure I am that
    it is entirely contrary to the spirit of the gospel,
    for its ministers to enter upon it from interested
    motives, or with great worldly expectations. On
    the contrary the commission is a sufficient call to
    them to venture all, and, like the primitive
    Christians, go every where preaching the gospel.
</p>
<p>
    It might be necessary, however, for two, at
    least, to go together, and in general I should
    think it best that they should be married men,
    and to prevent their time from being employed
    in procuring necessaries, two, or more, other
    persons, with their wives and families, might also
    accompany them, who should be wholly employed
    in providing for them. In most countries
    it would be necessary for them to cultivate a little
    spot of ground just for their support, which would
    be a resource to them, whenever their supplies
    failed. Not to mention the advantages they
    would reap from each others company, it would
    take off the enormous expence which has always
    attended undertakings of this kind, the first expence
    being the whole; for though a large colony
    needs support for a considerable time, yet so
    small a number would, upon receiving the first
    crop, maintain themselves. They would have
    the advantage of choosing their situation, their
    wants would be few; the women, and even the
    children, would be necessary for domestic purposes;
    and a few articles of stock, as a cow or
    two, and a bull, and a few other cattle of both
    sexes, a very few utensils of husbandry, and some
    corn to sow their land, would be sufficient. Those
    who attend the missionaries should understand
    husbandry, fishing, fowling, &amp;c. and be provided
    with the necessary implements for these purposes.
    Indeed a variety of methods may be thought of,
    and when once the work is undertaken, many
    things will suggest themselves to us, of which we
    at present can form no idea.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="sc">Fifthly</span>, As to <i>learning their languages</i>, the
    same means would be found necessary here as in
    trade between different nations. In some cases
    interpreters might be obtained, who might be
    employed for a time; and where these were not
    to be found, the missionaries must have patience,
    and mingle with the people, till they have learned
    so much of their language as to be able to communicate
    their ideas to them in it. It is well
    known to require no very extraordinary talents
    to learn, in the space of a year, or two at most,
    the language of any people upon earth, so much
    of it at least, as to be able to convey any sentiments
    we wish to their understandings.
</p>
<p>
    The Missionaries must be men of great piety,
    prudence, courage, and forbearance; of undoubted
    orthodoxy in their sentiments, and must enter
    with all their hearts into the spirit of their mission;
    they must be willing to leave all the comforts
    of life behind them, and to encounter all
    the hardships of a torrid, or a frigid climate, an
    uncomfortable manner of living, and every other
    inconvenience that can attend this undertaking.
    Clothing, a few knives, powder and shot, fishing-tackle,
    and the articles of husbandry above-mentioned,
    must be provided for them; and when
    arrived at the place of their destination, their first
    business must be to gain some acquaintance with
    the language of the natives, (for which purpose
    two would be better than one,) and by all lawful
    means to endeavour to cultivate a friendship with
    them, and as soon as possible let them know the
    errand for which they were sent. They must endeavour
    to convince them that it was their good
    alone, which induced them to forsake their friends,
    and all the comforts of their native country.
    They must be very careful not to resent injuries
    which may be offered to them, nor to think
    highly of themselves, so as to despise the poor
    heathens, and by those means lay a foundation
    for their resentment, or rejection of the gospel.
    They must take every opportunity of doing them
    good, and labouring, and travelling, night and
    day, they must instruct, exhort, and rebuke, with
    all long suffering, and anxious desire for them,
    and, above all, must be instant in prayer for the
    effusion of the Holy Spirit upon the people of
    their charge. Let but missionaries of the above
    description engage in the work, and we shall see
    that it is not impracticable.
</p>
<p>
    It might likewise be of importance, if God
    should bless their labours, for them to encourage
    any appearances of gifts amongst the people of
    their charge; if such should be raised up many
    advantages would be derived from their knowledge
    of the language, and customs of their countrymen;
    and their change of conduct would give
    great weight to their ministrations.

<h2>
    SECT.  V.
</h2>
<p class="subhead">
    <i>An Enquiry into the Duty of Christians in general, and
    what Means ought to be used, in order to promote
    this Work.</i>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    If the prophecies concerning the increase of
    Christ's kingdom be true, and if what has
    been advanced, concerning the commission given
    by him to his disciples being obligatory on us,
    be just, it must be inferred that all Christians
    ought heartily to concur with God in promoting
    his glorious designs, for <i>he that is joined to the
    Lord is one spirit</i>.
</p>
<p>
    One of the first, and most important of those
    duties which are incumbent upon us, is <i>fervent
    and united prayer</i>. However the influence of the
    Holy Spirit may be set at nought, and run down
    by many, it will be found upon trial, that all
    means which we can use, without it, will be ineffectual.
    If a temple is raised for God in the
    heathen world, it will not be <i>by might, nor by
    power</i>, nor by the authority of the magistrate, or
    the eloquence of the orator; <i>but by my Spirit, saith
    the Lord of Hosts</i>. We must therefore be in real
    earnest in supplicating his blessing upon our
    labours.
</p>
<p>
    It is represented in the prophets, that when
    there shall be <i>a great mourning in the land, as the
    mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon,
    and every family shall mourn apart, and their wives
    apart</i>, it shall all follow upon <i>a spirit of grace, and
    supplication</i>. And when these things shall take
    place, it is promised that <i>there shall be a fountain
    opened for the house of David, and for the inhabitants
    of Jerusalem, for sin, and for uncleanness</i>,&mdash;and that
    <i>the idols shall be destroyed</i>, and <i>the false prophets
    ashamed</i> of their profession. Zech. xii 10. 14.&mdash;xiii.
    1. 6. This prophesy seems to teach that
    when there shall be an universal conjunction in
    fervent prayer, and all shall esteem Zion's welfare
    as their own, then copious influences of the
    Spirit shall be shed upon the churches, which
    like a purifying <i>fountain</i> shall cleanse the servants
    of the Lord. Nor shall this cleansing influence
    stop here; all old idolatrous prejudices shall be
    rooted out, and truth prevail so gloriously that
    false teachers shall be so ashamed as rather to
    wish to be classed with obscure herdsmen, or the
    meanest peasants, than bear the ignominy attendant
    on their detection.
</p>
<p>
    The most glorious works of grace that have
    ever took place, have been in answer to prayer;
    and it is in this way, we have the greatest reason
    to suppose, that the glorious out-pouring of
    the Spirit, which we expect at last, will be
    bestowed.
</p>
<p>
    With respect to our own immediate connections,
    we have within these few years been favoured
    with some tokens for good, granted in
    answer to prayer, which should encourage us to
    persist, and increase in that important duty.  I
    trust our <i>monthly prayer-meetings</i> for the success of
    the gospel have not been in vain.  It is true a
    want of importunity too generally attends our
    prayers; yet unimportunate, and feeble as they
    have been, it is to be believed that God has
    heard, and in a measure answered them.  The
    churches that have engaged in the practice have
    in general since that time been evidently on the
    increase; some controversies which have long
    perplexed and divided the church, are more
    clearly stated than ever; there are calls to preach
    the gospel in many places where it has not been
    usually published; yea, a glorious door is opened,
    and is likely to be opened wider and wider, by
    the spread of civil and religious liberty,
    accompanied also by a diminution of the spirit of
    popery; a noble effort has been made to abolish the
    inhuman Slave-Trade, and though at present it
    has not been so successful as might be wished, yet
    it is to be hoped it will be persevered in, till it is
    accomplished.  In the mean time it is a satisfaction
    to consider that the late defeat of the abolition
    of the Slave-Trade has proved the occasion of a
    praise worthy effort to introduce a free settlement,
    at <i>Sierra Leona</i>, on the coast of Africa; an
    effort which, if succeeded with a divine blessing,
    not only promises to open a way for honourable
    commerce with that extensive country, and for
    the civilization of its inhabitants, but may prove
    the happy mean of introducing amongst them
    the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p>
    These are events that ought not to be over-looked;
    they are not to be reckoned small things;
    and yet perhaps they <i>are</i> small compared with
    what might have been expected, if all had cordially
    entered into the spirit of the proposal, so
    as to have made the cause of Christ their own, or
    in other words to have been so solicitous about
    it, as if their own advantage depended upon its
    success. If an holy solicitude had prevailed in
    all the assemblies of Christians in behalf of their
    Redeemer's kingdom, we might probably have
    seen before now, not only an <i>open door</i> for the
    gospel, but <i>many running to and fro, and knowledge
    increased</i>; or a diligent use of those means which
    providence has put in our power, accompanied
    with a greater blessing than ordinary from
    heaven.
</p>
<p>
    Many can do nothing but pray, and prayer is
    perhaps the only thing in which Christians of all
    denominations can cordially, and unreservedly
    unite; but in this we may all be one, and in this
    the strictest unanimity ought to prevail. Were
    the whole body thus animated by one soul, with
    what pleasure would Christians attend on all the
    duties of religion, and with what delight would
    their ministers attend on all the business of their
    calling.
</p>
<p>
    We must not be contented however with praying,
    without <i>exerting ourselves in the use of means</i> for
    the obtaining of those things we pray for. Were
    <i>the children of light</i>, but <i>as wise in their generation as
    the children of this world</i>, they would stretch every
    nerve to gain so glorious a prize, nor ever
    imagine that it was to be obtained in any other
    way.
</p>
<p>
    When a trading company have obtained their
    charter they usually go to its utmost limits; and
    their stocks, their ships, their officers, and men
    are so chosen, and regulated, as to be likely to
    answer their purpose; but they do not stop here,
    for encouraged by the prospect of success, they
    use every effort, cast their bread upon the waters,
    cultivate friendship with every one from whose
    information they expect the least advantage. They
    cross the widest and most tempestuous seas, and
    encounter the most unfavourable climates; they
    introduce themselves into the most barbarous
    nations, and sometimes undergo the most affecting
    hardships; their minds continue in a state of
    anxiety, and suspence, and a longer delay than
    usual in the arrival of their vessels agitates them
    with a thousand changeful thoughts, and foreboding
    apprehensions, which continue till the
    rich returns are safe arrived in port. But why
    these fears? Whence all these disquietudes, and
    this labour? Is it not because their souls enter
    into the spirit of the project, and their happiness
    in a manner depends on its success?&mdash;Christians
    are a body whose truest interest lies in the exaltation
    of the Messiah's kingdom. Their charter
    is very extensive, their encouragements exceeding
    great, and the returns promised infinitely superior
    to all the gains of the most lucrative fellowship.
    Let then every one in his station consider himself
    as bound to act with all his might, and in every
    possible way for God.
</p>
<p>
    Suppose a company of serious Christians,
    ministers and private persons, were to form
    themselves into a society, and make a number of
    rules respecting the regulation of the plan, and
    the persons who are to be employed as missionaries,
    the means of defraying the expence, &amp;c. &amp;c.
    This society must consist of persons whose hearts
    are in the work,  men of serious religion, and
    possessing a spirit of perseverance; there must be
    a determination not to admit any person who is
    not of this description, or to retain him longer
    than he answers to it.
</p>
<p>
    From such a society a <i>committee</i> might be appointed,
    whose business it should be to procure
    all the information they could upon the subject,
    to receive contributions, to enquire into the characters,
    tempers, abilities and religious views of
    the missionaries, and also to provide them with
    necessaries for their undertakings.
</p>
<p>
    They must also pay a great attention to the
    views of those who undertake this work; for want
    of this the missions to the Spice Islands, sent by
    the Dutch East-India Company, were soon corrupted,
    many going more for the sake of settling
    in a place where temporal gain invited them,
    than of preaching to the poor Indians. This
    soon introduced a number of indolent, or profligate
    persons, whose lives were a scandal to the
    doctrines which they preached: and by means of
    whom the gospel was ejected from Ternate, in
    1694, and Christianity fell into great disrepute in
    other places.
</p>
<p>
    If there is any reason for me to hope that I
    shall have any influence upon any of my brethren,
    and fellow Christians, probably it may be more
    especially amongst them of my own denomination.
    I would therefore propose that such a society and
    committee should be formed amongst the <i>particular
    baptist denomination</i>.
</p>
<p>
    I do not mean by this, in any wife to confine
    it to one denomination of Christians. I wish
    with all my heart, that every one who loves our
    Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, would in some way
    or other engage in it. But in the present divided
    state of Christendom, it would be more likely for
    good to be done by each denomination engaging
    separately in the work, than if they were to
    embark in it conjointly. There is room enough for
    us all, without interfering with each other; and
    if no unfriendly interference took place, each
    denomination would bear good will to the other,
    and wish, and pray for its success, considering it
    as upon the whole friendly to the great cause
    of true religion; but if all were intermingled, it
    is likely their private discords might throw a
    damp upon their spirits, and much retard their
    public usefulness.
</p>
<p>
    In respect to <i>contributions</i> for defraying the
    expences, money will doubtless be wanting; and suppose
    the rich were to embark a portion of that
    wealth over which God has made them stewards,
    in this important undertaking, perhaps there are
    few ways that would turn to a better account at
    last. Nor ought it to be confined to the <i>rich</i>; if
    persons in more moderate circumstances were to
    devote a portion, suppose a <i>tenth</i>, of their annual
    increase to the Lord, it would not only correspond
    with the practice of the Israelites, who lived under
    the Mosaic Oeconomy, but of the patriarchs
    Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, before that dispensation
    commenced. Many of our most eminent
    fore-fathers amongst the <i>Puritans</i>, followed that
    practice; and if that were but attended to now,
    there would not only be enough to support the
    ministry of the gospel at home, and to encourage
    <i>village preaching</i> in our respective neighbourhoods,
    but to defray the expences of carrying the gospel
    into the heathen world.
</p>
<p>
    If congregations were to open subscriptions of
    <i>one penny</i>, or more per week, according to their
    circumstances, and deposit it as a fund for the
    propogation of the gospel, much might be raised
    in this way. By such simple means they might
    soon have it in their power to introduce the
    preaching of the gospel into most of the villages
    in England; where, though men are placed whose
    business it should be to give light to those who sit
    in darkness, it is well known that they have it
    not. Where there was no person to open his
    house for the reception of the gospel, some other
    building might be procured for a small sum, and
    even then something considerable might be spared
    for the baptist, or other committees, for propogating
    the gospel amongst the heathen.
</p>
<p>
    Many persons have of late left off the use of
    <i>West-India sugar</i> on account of the iniquitous
    manner in which it is obtained. Those families
    who have done so, and have not substituted any
    thing else in its place, have not only cleansed
    their hands of blood, but have made a saving to
    their families, some of six pence, and some of a
    shilling a week. If this, or a part of this were
    appropriated to the uses before-mentioned, it
    would abundantly suffice. We have only to keep
    the end in view, and have our hearts thoroughly
    engaged in the pursuit of it, and means will not
    be very difficult.
</p>
<p>
    We are exhorted <i>to lay up treasure in heaven,
    where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, nor thieves
    break through and steal.</i> It is also declared that
    <i>whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</i>
    These Scriptures teach us that the enjoyments of
    the life to come, bear a near relation to that
    which now is; a relation similar to that of the
    harvest, and the seed. It is true all the reward
    is of mere grace, but it is nevertheless encouraging;
    what a <i>treasure</i>, what an <i>harvest</i> must
    await such characters as <span class="sc">Paul</span>, and
<span class="sc">Elliot</span>, and
    <span class="sc">Brainerd</span>, and others, who have given themselves
    wholly to the work of the Lord. What a heaven
    will it be to see the many myriads of poor heathens,
    of Britons amongst the rest, who by their
    labours have been brought to the knowledge of
    God. Surely a <i>crown of rejoicing</i> like this is worth
    aspiring to. Surely it is worth while to lay
    ourselves out with all our might, in promoting
    the cause, and kingdom of Christ.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
